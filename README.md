# snake-game

Created using JavaScript, HTML and SCSS. Uses a setInterval for tracking motion and a grid system with Divs for the board in additon to using an Array for the snake .

Arrow buttons on screen, or arrow keys on keyboard, are used for directional control. The aim of the game is to increase your score and the size of the snake by eating the food blocks.
